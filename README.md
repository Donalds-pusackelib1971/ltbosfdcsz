OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 that Kesari Chapter 2, you know the one - The Untold Story of Jallianwala Bagh. Jeez, my brain's still like... processing. Ever had that thing where you're 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 something, and you're like... so into it, but by the end, your mind's just a puddle of what the heck just happened? Yep, that’s me right now 😂. 

> Seriously, the whole Jallianwala Bagh thing, it's just so heavy, but the   was mad intense. The way they showed everything, makes you kinda wonder how much of history we even really know, you know what I mean? Sometimes I'm like, should I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to catch all those details again?

Anyway, those scenes were pretty wild. Like, you ever think about how brave people were back then? Could I even handle that kinda pressure? Probably not, I'd probably just peace out 🙄. And then you see those characters just standing their ground like it's no big deal... totally respect that, even if it did break my brain a little.

What really got me though, was the music. It’s all epic and stuff. Like, why does it always feel like the soundtrack to history has to be extra dramatic? I started 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   thinking I'd just chill, and there I was, all wrapped up in emotional chaos. Classic, right?

Then there’s the dialogue. Some of it was like woah, did people actually talk like that? So formal and intense, maybe we should bring back that old-school talk, it’s got some serious flair. But probably this brain of mine couldn’t handle it! Ha!

for i in range(5): print(Why am I even coding right now?)

But yeah, in the end, just glad I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 it. It was a ride. Now I’m here like... time for a light comedy or something, cuz reality check, I need to unwind! Hit me up if you’ve seen it too! Or if you're planning to, seriously, let's swap notes on this one.
